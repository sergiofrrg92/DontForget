# Don't Forget it!!

Don't Forget it!! is a persistent reminder app that focuses solely on making sure the user doesn't miss something important.

It tries to satisfy the need (or at least, my need), to avoid forgetting those small important things that keep happening on a daily basis like:
 - Don't forget to buy "item"!
 - Don't forget to call "person"!
 - Don't forget to pick "something" up from the mailroom!
 - Don't forget to wish a happy birthday to "person"
 
All those events happen constantly, and my experience is that the default apps on our phones don't quite cover them correctly.

Yes you can create calendar events, but that's for more long term, future events, and also, if you want a reminder for those, 
there are extra steps during the setup for them. So, the reminder is not the default, the event is the default, and the reminder 
is something you can add on.

The same with the note apps, that allow you to set a reminder for one of the notes but they are still not a reminder app, or the
alarm apps, that allow you to add a label to the alarm so you can read it when it rings.

Those are all proxy reminders, applications that, as a side effect, can help you remember something, but I don't want that.

** I just want to create a reminder **

And that's what ** Don't Forget it!! ** does.
